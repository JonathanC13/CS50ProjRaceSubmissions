# Race Submissions

This website is truly an uninspired, unimaginative, and unoriginal idea. It’s intended function is to provide a platform for people to submit and view their submissions from various racing games so that they can compare to others. Features include; user sessions, searching submissions, submitting new submissions , a basic profile page with the user’s display name, profile picture, and submission aggregated information, and updating the user’s information. The project was executed by developing a web-based application using HTML, JavaScript, Flask, and SQLite3. 

Truthfully, I am of the opinion that I am not a very creative person, an ideas man, or an innovator. My mind feels like a clogged catalytic converter than an engine. Since it was a struggle to even conjure a single original thought, I settled on the web-based application to save and display racing game records submitted by it’s users. At the time, I had bought a racing wheel, pedals, and shifter to enjoy the experience of not owning a car and driving a virtual one.

The skills that may or may not have been improved, assuming that I even had a minuscule amount of understanding to begin with, are JavaScript and applying the method of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, AJAX, on some sections of the web pages in an attempt to minimize the number of times the page reloads. At least I put some time behind the wheel, even if it was only mere minutes or a few hours each day. This project definitely took longer than it should have considering the scope of it.
